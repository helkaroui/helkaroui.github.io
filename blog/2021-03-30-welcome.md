## Hello World ðŸŽ‰
It's been a while since I last tried to maintain a personal website and an active blog. Back in the years, I was still a fresh graduate and I had so many things to learn at the same time. I rarely had anything I could blog about. 

Years come by and go, now I'm a corporate drone -- employed as a Data Engineer to consult others on their tech problems --. Yep, we are called "Drones", that's fine for me, I'm enjoying learning new stuff everyday, help building cool architectures and solving others issues.

So here we are, and it's time to fill this up a bit more. Thankfully, I already got some ideas.
