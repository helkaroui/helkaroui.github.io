## It's been a while since I've learned anything new ! 
It's been three years that I'm working as a data engineer and I've learned a lot when I early joined Datafab consulting. My learning curve started to stagnate for some time and I have the impression that I no longer learn new stuff.

In the past few years, I've been learning new tools and technologies by practicing and writing examples. That's a good way to apprehend complex tools and frameworks like Apache Spark. But in most cases, I didn't master the theoretical part.

The reason was because of my educational background and working environment. I've been exposed to a culture that emphases getting things done in time rather than making quality code and consistent results. 

So I've decided to change things and follow a new learning strategy. So let's jump right in. Here are six ways that I've decided to follow in the next months to speed up the learning process :

## 6 ways to learn fast
### 1. Say out loud what you want to remember
Research shows that compared to reading or thinking silently (as if there's another way to think), the act of speech is a "quite powerful mechanism for improving memory for selected information."

### 2. Take notes by hand, make a summary, and share it on a blog site
research shows handwriting your notes means you'll learn more. Oddly enough, taking notes by hand enhances both comprehension and retention, possibly because instead of just serving as a quasi-stenographer, you're forced to put things in your own words in order to keep up.

### 3. Build on things you do know
Relating something new to something you're familiar with is called associative learning. In simple terms, whenever you say, "Oh, I get it... this is basically like that," you're using associative learning. 

### 4. Teach someone else
It may be occasionally true that those who can't, teach... but research shows it's definitely true that those who teach speed up their learning and retain more.

### 5. Learn several subjects in succession
Instead of blocking (focusing on one subject, one task, or one skill during a learning session) learn or practice several subjects or skills in succession. 

### 6. Get more sleep
Sleep is when most of the memory consolidation process occurs. That's why even a short nap can improve your memory recall.


## Learning Plan
### List of tools
I've also dressed a list of tools that I want to learn / master fast :
- Kafka : is a message broker
- Go : an awesome language to learn
- Airflow : is a workflow management platform created by Airbnb
- BigQuery : is a data warehouse developed by Google
- MLFlow : is a platforme to streamline machine learning development
- ElasticSearch : the most famous Search engine 
- Apache Hive : is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop


### What to produce at the end ?
So the last part of the plan is to write comprehensive tutorials, examples and summaries then share it on sharek.dev.

For each tool, I will follow these steps :
- Discover the tool documentations
- Read some tutorials and getting started articles
- Write a summary on a notebook
- Summaries what I've learned in sharek.dev:
  - Create a "Quick start" guide
  - Create a "Cheat sheet" that lists quick commands and cool tricks
  - Create a "internals" section that summaries core concepts
  - Create a "Best practices" article to dress the most important practices to be aware of.

I hope this learning method will give its fruits. I'll keep you updated of the result !
Cheers



## Updates 
**10/11/2021** - Here is what I've made on my first day of Fast-Learning strategy  
- I started with Kafka and wrote quick notes
- I've got into Go language and I love it ! So I started a new section, check it [here](/developer/languages/go/quick_start)
- I started reading the core concepts of Airflow, but got tired ðŸ¥±
