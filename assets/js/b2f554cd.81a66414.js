My learning curve started to stagnate for some time and I have the impression that I no longer learn new stuff.\\n\\nIn the past few years, I\'ve been learning new tools and technologies by practicing and writing examples. That\'s a good way to apprehend complex tools and frameworks like Apache Spark. But in most cases, I didn\'t master the theoretical part.\\n\\nThe reason was because of my educational background and working environment. I\'ve been exposed to a culture that emphases getting things done in time rather than making quality code and consistent results. \\n\\nSo I\'ve decided to change things and follow a new learning strategy. So let\'s jump right in. Here are six ways that I\'ve decided to follow in the next months to speed up the learning process :\\n\\n## 6 ways to learn fast\\n### 1. Say out loud what you want to remember\\nResearch shows that compared to reading or thinking silently (as if there\'s another way to think), the act of speech is a \\"quite powerful mechanism for improving memory for selected information.\\"\\n\\n### 2. Take notes by hand, make a summary, and share it on a blog site\\nresearch shows handwriting your notes means you\'ll learn more. Oddly enough, taking notes by hand enhances both comprehension and retention, possibly because instead of just serving as a quasi-stenographer, you\'re forced to put things in your own words in order to keep up.\\n\\n### 3. Build on things you do know\\nRelating something new to something you\'re familiar with is called associative learning. In simple terms, whenever you say, \\"Oh, I get it... this is basically like that,\\" you\'re using associative learning. \\n\\n### 4. Teach someone else\\nIt may be occasionally true that those who can\'t, teach... but research shows it\'s definitely true that those who teach speed up their learning and retain more.\\n\\n### 5. Learn several subjects in succession\\nInstead of blocking (focusing on one subject, one task, or one skill during a learning session) learn or practice several subjects or skills in succession. \\n\\n### 6. Get more sleep\\nSleep is when most of the memory consolidation process occurs. That\'s why even a short nap can improve your memory recall.\\n\\n\\n## Learning Plan\\n### List of tools\\nI\'ve also dressed a list of tools that I want to learn / master fast :\\n- Kafka : is a message broker\\n- Go : an awesome language to learn\\n- Airflow : is a workflow management platform created by Airbnb\\n- BigQuery : is a data warehouse developed by Google\\n- MLFlow : is a platforme to streamline machine learning development\\n- ElasticSearch : the most famous Search engine \\n- Apache Hive : is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop\\n\\n\\n### What to produce at the end ?\\nSo the last part of the plan is to write comprehensive tutorials, examples and summaries then share it on sharek.dev.\\n\\nFor each tool, I will follow these steps :\\n- Discover the tool documentations\\n- Read some tutorials and getting started articles\\n- Write a summary on a notebook\\n- Summaries what I\'ve learned in sharek.dev:\\n  - Create a \\"Quick start\\" guide\\n  - Create a \\"Cheat sheet\\" that lists quick commands and cool tricks\\n  - Create a \\"internals\\" section that summaries core concepts\\n  - Create a \\"Best practices\\" article to dress the most important practices to be aware of.\\n\\nI hope this learning method will give its fruits. I\'ll keep you updated of the result !\\nCheers\\n\\n\\n\\n## Updates \\n**10/11/2021** - Here is what I\'ve made on my first day of Fast-Learning strategy  \\n- I started with Kafka and wrote quick notes\\n- I\'ve got into Go language and I love it ! So I started a new section, check it [here](/developer/languages/go/quick_start)\\n- I started reading the core concepts of Airflow, but got tired \ud83e\udd71"},{"id":"todo","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/todo","editUrl":"https://github.com/helkaroui/helkaroui.github.io/edit/develop/blog/blog/2021-11-09-todo.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-09-todo.md","title":"A curated list of my Todos :)","description":"Todo","date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 9, 2021","tags":[{"label":"prefecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/prefecture"},{"label":"bot","permalink":"/blog/tags/bot"}],"readingTime":0.04,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza EL KAROUI","title":"Freelance, Senior Data Engineer / DevOps","url":"https://github.com/helkaroui","email":"helkarou@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22795356?s=96&v=4&fit=cover&mask=circle&maxage=7d","key":"hamza"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"todo","title":"A curated list of my Todos :)","authors":["hamza"],"tags":["prefecture","bot"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to learn Big data tools online (fast)","permalink":"/blog/fast-learning"},"nextItem":{"title":"Update a running pod in k8s","permalink":"/blog/Update a running pod in k8s"}},"content":"## Todo \\n- Prefecture Bot\\n- FastAPI Examples\\n- Prefecture Android App"},{"id":"Update a running pod in k8s","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Update a running pod in k8s","editUrl":"https://github.com/helkaroui/helkaroui.github.io/edit/develop/blog/blog/2021-06-14-update-running-pod.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-14-update-running-pod.md","title":"Update a running pod in k8s","description":"Problem","date":"2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"k8s","permalink":"/blog/tags/k-8-s"}],"readingTime":1.1333333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza EL KAROUI","title":"Freelance, Senior Data Engineer / DevOps","url":"https://github.com/helkaroui","email":"helkarou@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22795356?s=96&v=4&fit=cover&mask=circle&maxage=7d","key":"hamza"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Update a running pod in k8s","title":"Update a running pod in k8s","authors":["hamza"],"tags":["k8s"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A curated list of my Todos :)","permalink":"/blog/todo"},"nextItem":{"title":"Install docker compose on RPI","permalink":"/blog/Install docker compose on RPI"}},"content":"## Problem\\nSome tasks might require debugging a failing pod in k8s and so fixing and files inside the pod. This article describes how to perform these operations.\\n\\nIn a previous project, we were running a huge Play application on Kubernetes. The app was failing just after initialization, so we had to change some configuration at the fly (coz the CI/CD was a boggling nightmare and was failing the build)\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\n### Get into the failling pod\\nIf your pod is always crashing after restarts, consider changing it\'s entrypoint to allow you to enter your pod and run it manually. \\nTo do so, edit your deployment and change your entrypoint so that it never dies.\\n\\n```shell\\nk edit deployment.apps my-deployment\\n```\\n\\n```yaml {10,11}\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: ubuntu\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: ubuntu\\n    image: ubuntu:latest\\n    # Just spin & wait forever\\n    command: [ \\"/bin/bash\\", \\"-c\\", \\"--\\" ]\\n    args: [ \\"while true; do sleep 30; done;\\" ]\\n```\\n\\nNow restart your pod, and it will keep running. Now you need to enter the pod :\\n```shell\\nk exec -it my-pod bash\\n```\\n\\nOnce in, you can investigate or run your application manually with extra parameters for debugging.\\n\\n### Update a Jar file\\nNow copy the jar out from the pod :\\n```\\nkubectl cp <your-pod-name>:<src-path> <local-dest-path> \\n```\\n\\nOnce you have the jar in your workdirectory, you can update it with the right configuration.\\nTo do so, you need to run through these steps :  \\n1- extract the file you want to update :\\n```\\njar xf my-play-app.jar application.conf\\n```\\n2- Edit the .conf file\\n```\\nvim application.conf\\n```\\n3- Update the jar with the modified .conf file\\n```\\njar uf my-play-app.jar application.conf\\n```\\n\\n### Restart the pod\\nNow you can re-upload the jar to the pod :\\n```\\nkubectl cp <local-dest-path> <your-pod-name>:<src-path>\\n```\\n\\nDon\'t forget to reinitiate the deployment to the default entrypoint \\n```shell\\nk edit deployment.apps my-deployment\\n```\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: ubuntu\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: ubuntu\\n    image: ubuntu:latest\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it \ud83d\ude01"},{"id":"Install docker compose on RPI","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Install docker compose on RPI","editUrl":"https://github.com/helkaroui/helkaroui.github.io/edit/develop/blog/blog/2021-04-07-install-docker-on-rpi.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-07-install-docker-on-rpi.md","title":"Install docker compose on RPI","description":"I like to use Docker containers on my Raspberry Pis as they come with a great layer of abstraction and portability.","date":"2021-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 7, 2021","tags":[{"label":"docker","permalink":"/blog/tags/docker"},{"label":"RPI","permalink":"/blog/tags/rpi"}],"readingTime":0.6633333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza EL KAROUI","title":"Freelance, Senior Data Engineer / DevOps","url":"https://github.com/helkaroui","email":"helkarou@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22795356?s=96&v=4&fit=cover&mask=circle&maxage=7d","key":"hamza"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Install docker compose on RPI","title":"Install docker compose on RPI","authors":["hamza"],"tags":["docker","RPI"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Update a running pod in k8s","permalink":"/blog/Update a running pod in k8s"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"I like to use Docker containers on my Raspberry Pis as they come with a great layer of abstraction and portability. \\nHere is how to get your Raspberry Pi ready for Docker and Docker-Compose.\\n\\n# Install Docker\\nit\'s time to install Docker.
