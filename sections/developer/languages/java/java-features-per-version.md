## Java 9 Features:

1. **Module System (Project Jigsaw):** Java 9 introduced a module system to improve modularity by encapsulating code into modules, allowing better management of dependencies and reducing classpath issues.

2. **JShell (REPL):** The JShell tool provides an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for testing and experimenting with Java code snippets.

3. **Private Methods in Interfaces:** Java 9 allowed interfaces to have private methods, enhancing code organization and reducing code duplication in interface implementations.

## Java 10 Features:

1. **Local Variable Type Inference (var):** Java 10 introduced the `var` keyword for local variable type inference, allowing the compiler to infer the type of a variable from its initializer.

2. **Application Class-Data Sharing:** This feature enhances startup time by sharing certain runtime data across multiple Java processes.

## Java 11 Features:

1. **HTTP Client (Standard)**: Java 11 introduced a new HttpClient API for making HTTP requests, providing a more modern and flexible way to work with HTTP.

2. **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:** Similar to the `var` keyword for local variables, Java 11 allowed using the `var` keyword for lambda parameters.

3. **Epsilon Garbage Collector:** A no-op garbage collector introduced to handle scenarios where you want to disable garbage collection.

## Java 12 Features:

1. **Switch Expressions (Preview):** Java 12 introduced a preview feature that enhances the traditional switch statement to support multiple branches with expressions.

2. **New String Methods:** Java 12 added new String methods, including `indent()` for formatting and `transform()` for advanced string manipulation.

## Java 13 Features:

1. **Switch Expressions (Standard):** The preview feature introduced in Java 12 became a standard feature in Java 13.

2. **Text Blocks (Preview):** A preview feature that simplifies the creation of multi-line strings, enhancing readability of code.

## Java 14 Features:

1. **Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Preview):** A preview feature that allows pattern matching with `instanceof` and `switch` expressions to simplify code and enhance type checking.

2. **Record Classes (Preview):** Another preview feature introducing concise and immutable data classes, reducing boilerplate code.

## Java 15 Features:

1. **Sealed Classes (Preview):** A preview feature that allows you to control which classes or interfaces can be subclasses.

2. **Text Blocks (Standard):** The text blocks feature introduced in Java 13 became a standard feature in Java 15.

## Java 16 Features:

1. **Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Standard):** The pattern matching for `instanceof` feature introduced in Java 14 became a standard feature in Java 16.

2. **Records (Standard):** The record classes feature introduced in Java 14 became a standard feature in Java 16.

3. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview):** A preview feature that provides an API to interact with native code and memory, enhancing interoperability.

Please note that the features listed are not exhaustive, and each Java version also includes various other improvements, enhancements, and bug fixes. If you are interested in the latest updates beyond Java 16, I recommend checking the official Oracle Java website or the OpenJDK project for the most up-to-date information on Java's features and improvements.
