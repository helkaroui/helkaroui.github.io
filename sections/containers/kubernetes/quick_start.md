Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.
