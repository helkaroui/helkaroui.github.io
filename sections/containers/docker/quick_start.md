title: "Quick Start Guide: Getting Started with Docker"
---

Docker is a widely used platform that enables you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers package software and its dependencies, making it easy to ensure consistency across different environments. Here's a quick start guide to help you get started with Docker:

**1. Installation:**

Docker can be installed on various operating systems. Here's a simple guide for installing Docker on a Linux-based system:

- Install Docker: Use your package manager to install Docker.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker.io
  ```

- Start and Enable Docker: Start the Docker service and enable it to start on boot.
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  ```

**2. Basic Docker Concepts:**

- **Images:**
  Images are the building blocks of containers. They contain an executable software package, along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations.

- **Containers:**
  Containers are instances of Docker images. They run in isolated environments with their own filesystem, network, and processes.

**3. Basic Docker Commands:**

- **Pull an Image:**
  To pull an image from the Docker Hub repository:
  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu:latest
  ```

- **Run a Container:**
  To run a container based on an image:
  ```bash
  docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
  ```

- **List Containers:**
  To list all running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **Stop and Remove a Container:**
  To stop and remove a container:
  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

- **List Images:**
  To list locally available Docker images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **Remove an Image:**
  To remove a locally cached image:
  ```bash
  docker rmi ubuntu:latest
  ```

**4. Building Docker Images:**

- **Dockerfile:**
  Docker images are often created using a "Dockerfile," which is a script that defines the steps to build an image.

- **Building an Image:**
  Create a Dockerfile in a directory with your application code and run:
  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp .
  ```

**5. Networking and Ports:**

- **Port Mapping:**
  To map a container port to a host port:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
  ```

**6. Cleaning Up:**

- **Remove All Containers:**
  To remove all stopped containers:
  ```bash
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
  ```

- **Remove All Images:**
  To remove all unused images:
  ```bash
  docker image prune -a
  ```

These are just some of the basic steps to get started with Docker. Docker provides more advanced features for managing containers, networks, volumes, and orchestrating applications. The official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is a comprehensive resource for diving deeper into Docker's capabilities and usage.
