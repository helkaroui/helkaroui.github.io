title: GroupByKey imbalanced dataset
---

In this article, I'll describe a data skew problem that I faced in production and walk you step-by-step through the
debugging process and possible fixes. The following code examples and data are intended to mimic the real problem.

## Problem statement

## Debugging through the Spark UI

## Demystifying the issue

## Solution

### 1- Replacing `groupByKey` with `reduceByKey`


### 2- Grouping in steps
