Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster computing framework with (mostly) in-memory data processing engine that can do ETL, analytics, machine learning and graph processing on large volumes of data at rest (batch processing) or in motion (streaming processing) with rich concise high-level APIs for the programming languages: Scala, Python, Java, R, and SQL.

You could also describe Spark as a distributed, data processing engine for batch and streaming modes featuring SQL queries, graph processing, and machine learning.
