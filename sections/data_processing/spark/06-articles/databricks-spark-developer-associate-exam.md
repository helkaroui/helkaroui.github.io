Here are 30 example questions for the Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark certification exam, along with their answers:

1. **Question:** What is Apache Spark's primary abstraction for working with structured data?
   
   **Answer:** DataFrame

2. **Question:** Which programming languages are officially supported by Apache Spark?
   
   **Answer:** Scala, Python, Java, and R

3. **Question:** What is the fundamental unit of data in Spark, represented as an immutable distributed collection of objects?
   
   **Answer:** Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)

4. **Question:** Which Spark component is responsible for managing the execution of tasks in a parallel and fault-tolerant manner?
   
   **Answer:** Spark Core

5. **Question:** Which operation in Spark allows you to transform an RDD into another RDD by applying a function to each element?
   
   **Answer:** `map`

6. **Question:** Which transformation operation in Spark returns a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition?
   
   **Answer:** `filter`

7. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `groupBy` transformation in Spark?
   
   **Answer:** It groups elements in an RDD based on a key and applies a function to each group.

8. **Question:** Which Spark transformation allows you to perform an aggregation across all elements of an RDD?
   
   **Answer:** `reduce`

9. **Question:** What is the primary advantage of using DataFrames over RDDs in Spark?
   
   **Answer:** DataFrames offer better optimization and execution performance due to their schema information.

10. **Question:** Which Spark operation is used to join two DataFrames based on a common column?
   
    **Answer:** `join`

11. **Question:** In Spark, what is the purpose of a broadcast variable?
    
    **Answer:** It allows you to efficiently distribute a read-only value to worker nodes.

12. **Question:** Which operation in Spark returns the first element of an RDD?
    
    **Answer:** `first`

13. **Question:** Which transformation in Spark flattens a nested structure by turning it into a flat list?
    
    **Answer:** `flatMap`

14. **Question:** What is the Spark SQL API used for?
    
    **Answer:** It provides a way to work with structured data using SQL queries or DataFrame operations.

15. **Question:** Which Spark transformation is used to sample data from an RDD?
    
    **Answer:** `sample`

16. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `distinct` transformation in Spark?
    
    **Answer:** It returns a new RDD containing distinct elements of the original RDD.

17. **Question:** In Spark, what does "lazy evaluation" mean?
    
    **Answer:** Transformations on RDDs are not executed immediately but only when an action is called.

18. **Question:** Which Spark action returns the number of elements in an RDD?
    
    **Answer:** `count`

19. **Question:** What is the difference between `cache` and `persist` operations in Spark?
    
    **Answer:** Both store RDD in memory, but `persist` allows you to specify storage level.

20. **Question:** Which action in Spark returns a new RDD containing all elements of the source RDD in random order?
    
    **Answer:** `repartition`

21. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `union` transformation in Spark?
    
    **Answer:** It combines two RDDs to create a new RDD containing all elements from both RDDs.

22. **Question:** Which transformation in Spark returns a new RDD by applying a function to each partition?
    
    **Answer:** `mapPartitions`

23. **Question:** What does the `collect` action in Spark do?
    
    **Answer:** It retrieves all elements of an RDD and brings them to the driver program.

24. **Question:** In Spark, what is the purpose of the `take` action?
    
    **Answer:** It returns the first n elements of an RDD as an array.

25. **Question:** Which transformation operation in Spark groups elements of an RDD by key and applies an aggregation function?
    
    **Answer:** `reduceByKey`

26. **Question:** What is the main advantage of using DataFrames over RDDs for structured data processing?
    
    **Answer:** DataFrames allow Spark to optimize query execution and offer better performance.

27. **Question:** What is the key difference between a transformation and an action in Spark?
    
    **Answer:** Transformations create a new RDD from an existing one, while actions return a value or write data.

28. **Question:** Which action in Spark returns a new RDD containing a specified number of elements from the beginning?
    
    **Answer:** `take`

29. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `sortBy` transformation in Spark?
    
    **Answer:** It sorts the elements of an RDD based on a key.

30. **Question:** Which Spark transformation operation is used to filter an RDD by applying a function to each element?
    
    **Answer:** `filter`
