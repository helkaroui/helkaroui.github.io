## Spark Plugin Framework
It was introduced in Spark 3.0. 
This plugin allows users to plug custom code to the driver or/and worker instances at start time. This allows customization to be fairly simple and straightforward. It allows to have custom metrics tracking and more control over the Spark application.


## Features :
**Access to the Spark Context** 
Spark plugin gives access to the Spark Context instance and thus a way in to application metrics.
**Ability to Communicate Between Driver and Executor** 
Spark plugin framework exposes a RPC communication option between driver and executor plugins. This communication can be used to send any user defined messages between executors and driver.
**Ability to push dynamic events to driver and executor** 
Spark plugin framework allows user to run arbitrary listeners on driver or executor side. This allows for a communication to spark JVMâ€™s from the external application. As these plugins have access to spark context, this will allow for dynamic control of the execution from outside which is very powerful.
