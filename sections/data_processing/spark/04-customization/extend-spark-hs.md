*Hello fellow Spark enthusiasts!* Are you ready to turbocharge your Spark experience? In this article, we're going to embark on an exciting journey to extend the Spark UI. Spark UI is already pretty awesome, but did you know you can customize it to suit your specific needs and preferences? That's right! 

Whether you're a data engineer, scala developer or DevOps, extending Spark UI opens up a world of possibilities in terms of productivity and operations. So, grab your favorite beverage, fire up your Spark cluster, and let's dive into the wonderful world of extending Spark UI together!


# Why Extend Spark UI?
Before we start extending Spark UI, let's take a moment to appreciate what it offers out of the box. Spark UI is like a control panel for your Spark applications, providing valuable insights into their execution. From tracking job progress to monitoring resource utilization, Spark UI gives you the tools you need to understand and optimize your Spark workflows.

You might be wondering, "If Spark UI is already so great, why bother extending it?" Well, that's the beauty of customization! By extending Spark UI, you can tailor it to your specific use cases, workflows, and preferences. Whether you need additional metrics, custom visualizations, or integration with external systems, extending Spark UI empowers you to take your Spark experience to the next level.

**Use Cases for Extended Spark UI:**

- **Performance Optimization:** Custom metrics and visualizations to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Enhanced views of job dependencies and workflow execution for complex data pipelines.
- **Integration with External** Systems: Pulling in data from external sources for comprehensive monitoring and analysis.
- **Custom User Experiences:** Tailoring Spark UI to the specific needs and preferences of your team or organization.


# Getting Started:
Alright, let's roll up our sleeves and get started! To extend Spark UI, you'll need a basic understanding of web development technologies like JavaScript, as well as familiarity with Spark's APIs and architecture. Don't worry if you're not an expert – we'll take it step by step, and I'll be here to guide you through the process.

We start by cloning the Spark repository localy and load it into our favourite IDE, in my case it's Intellij Idea.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:apache/spark.git
```
