title: Minio
---

Minio is a popular open-source object storage server compatible with the Amazon S3 cloud storage service. Apps that have
been set up to talk to Amazon S3, can also be set up to talk to Minio, making Minio a viable alternative to S3 if you
want more control over your object storage server. The service stores unstructured data such as photos, videos, log
files, backups, and container / VM images, and can even provide a single object storage server that aggregates multiple
drives spread across multiple servers.

## Step 1 - Installation and configuration of the Minio server
To install minio, we need to get the latest release with this command :
wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio

Then, we will make it executable and move it under /usr/bin, to be accessible from the cli:
chmod +x minio
sudo mv minio /usr/bin

Now we need to create a directory where to store our object storage data.
mkdir /data

Finally we will run the server, the admin credentials are passed to minio through env variables :
export MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin
export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
minio server /data

The server starts on address http://localhost:9000

## Step 2 - Run minio as a service



## Step N - Hardening the server's security
MinIO supports Server-Side Encryption (SSE) of objects, where the MinIO stores objects on disk in an encrypted format.
Only clients with access to the correct secret key can decrypt and read the object.

MinIO supports two types of SSE encryption:
* SSE-C: The server uses a secret key provided by the client to perform encryption and decryption. SSE-C requires TLS connectivity between clients and the MinIO server.
* SSE-S3: The server uses a secret key managed by a Key Management System (KMS) to perform encryption and decryption. SSE-S3 requires using MinIO KES and a supported KMS.
