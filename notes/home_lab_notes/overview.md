I've always wanted to setup my own homelab, and control every components in it, from security to applications delevery. So in this blog, I'll take you throght my long journey to setup the perfect homelab setup.

Originally I planned to host several entertainment services, like home media center, a NAS storage and few microservices running on a raspberry pi or a NUC... but I changed my mind. Instead, I opted for a kubernetes cluster hosting advanced scrappers and services running on a custom build server with a decent configuration.

Reasons for the this workstation:
- Can take up to 128GB of RAM (possibly 64GB still to confirm)
- Plenty of Space in the chassis for upgrades / expansion
